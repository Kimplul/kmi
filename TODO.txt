+ Investigate GCC/Clang builtin atomic operations?

+ Add in mapping the same memory to two different processes
+ Create sensible thread handling
+ Add in init process loading
+ Make sure vmap is in 4K increments or whatever
+ Remove/converge convnum and debugging __atoi
+ Create actual init program
	+ That will need some kind of linking info, say, `place .text etc above
	0xffffffadsadsad` or whatever. Should be doable, let's see.
