Mostly the same as the Linux coding standars, some additions:
+	Local functions should be marked static and be prefixed with __, the idea is
	to hopefully minimize confusion about which header file the function came from.
	I know, pretty dumb, but looks cool :)

+	structs and enums shouldn't be suffixed with _t, whereas scalar types
	should.
