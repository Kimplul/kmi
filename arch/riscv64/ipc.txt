Current idea: Have a bunch of servers that allow IPC requests. Each IPC request
to a server temporarily maps the server's address space etc. into the calling
functions address space, except for the callstack. Callstack should be a bunch
of 4K pages, so they can easily be mapped to be unreachable by deeper nested
server calls, whereas the normal stack can be mapped to higher order pages to
save a little bit of memory access latency when the client is operating
normally.
